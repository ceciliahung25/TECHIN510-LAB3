# Promptbase

Promptbase is an interactive web application built using Streamlit, designed for managing and organizing ChatGPT prompts. It facilitates the creation, retrieval, and categorization of prompts for various uses such as writing refinement, article summaries, conversation starters, and more. The application allows users to engage with their saved prompts through filters and enables features like marking prompts as favorites. It serves as a valuable tool for writers, researchers, and anyone interested in streamlining their creative workflow.

## Getting Started

To set up Promptbase locally, follow these steps:

```
python -m venv venv                # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate           # Activate the virtual environment (macOS/Linux)
venv\Scripts\activate              # Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Install dependencies
streamlit run app.py               # Run the application
```
